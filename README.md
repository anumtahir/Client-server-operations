# Client-server-operations
The purpose of this project is to deal with client and server i.e.
1. Make connection
2. TIME (sends the time back to client)
3. MAC (sends the server’s MAC address to client)
4. IP (sends the server’s IP address to client)
5. LIST (sends the filenames present in the server’s directory. NOT THE FILES, only the
fileNAMES)
6. OS (sends the server’s operating system information to the client. The platform module
may be helpful here)
7.USERS (sends the list of users present on the server to the client. Same result as when you
type w in the terminal)
8. Create files on client and server
9. Send and receive files
10. Delete files
